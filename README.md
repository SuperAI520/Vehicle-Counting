# VEHICLE DETECTION, TRACKING AND COUNTING
This project focuses on "Vechicle Detection, Tracking and Counting" by [TensorFlow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection). This project has more than just counting vehicles, here are some additional capabilities of this project;

- Recognition of approximate vehicle color
- Detection of vehicle's direction of travel
- Prediction the speed of the vehicle
- Prediction of approximate vehicle size
